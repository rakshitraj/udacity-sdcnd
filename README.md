# Self Driving Car Nanodegree by Udacity

This repository contains code and writeups for projects and labs completed as a part of UDACITY's self driving car nanodegree program.

## List of Projects



### PART 1



### [Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensor Fusion](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/168c60f1-cc92-450a-a91b-e427c326e6a7)

Here, you'll first become an expert in applying Computer Vision and Deep Learning on automotive problems. You will teach the car to detect lane lines, predict steering angle, and more all based on just camera data, along with working with lidar and radar data later on.

- Project: [Finding Lane Lines](https://github.com/rakshitraj/udacity-sdcnd/tree/main/Part1/Project1-Finding-Lane-Lines)
- Project: [Advanced Lane Finding](https://github.com/rakshitraj/udacity-sdcnd/tree/main/Part1/Project2-Advanced-Lane_Lines)
- Project: [Traffic Sign Classifier](https://github.com/rakshitraj/udacity-sdcnd/tree/main/Part1/Project3-Traffic-Sign-Classifier)
- Project: [Behavioral Cloning](https://github.com/rakshitraj/udacity-sdcnd/tree/main/Part1/Project4-Behavioral-Cloning)
- Project: [Extended Kalman Filters](https://github.com/rakshitraj/udacity-sdcnd/tree/main/Part1/Project5-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Sensor-Fusion)

Estimated time: 81 days



### PART 2



### [Localization, Path Planning, Control, and System Integration](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/b9040951-b43f-4dd3-8b16-76e7b52f4d9d)

Here, you'll expand on your sensor knowledge to localize and control the vehicle. You'll evaluate sensor data from camera, radar, lidar, and GPS, and use these in closed-loop controllers that actuate the vehicle, finishing by combining all your skills on a real self-driving car!

- Project: [Kidnapped Vehicle](https://github.com/rakshitraj/udacity-sdcnd/tree/main/Part2/Project1-Kidnapped-Vehicle-Project)
- Project: [Highway Driving](https://github.com/rakshitraj/udacity-sdcnd/tree/main/Part2/Project2-highway-driving)
- Project: [PID Controller](https://github.com/rakshitraj/udacity-sdcnd/tree/main/Part2/Project3-PID-Controller)
- Project: [System Integration](https://github.com/rakshitraj/udacity-sdcnd/tree/main/Part2/Project4-System-Integration-Capstone)
